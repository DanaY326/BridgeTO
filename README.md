# BridgeTO

Winner of the "Most Kingdom Impact" category in the Indigitous #Hack2025 Toronto Hackathon.

## Motivation

We wanted to build something to help the least reached people in our community. BridgeTO is a website that allows organizations to host events to reach out to, include and honor those in our community who are usually forgotten. 
It provides resources and tools using the Joshua Project API to spread awareness about least reached people groups and facilitates organizations in connecting with them.
One tool in particular is an interactive map that shows the organizations and concentrations of least reached peoples in different neighborhoods.
Another is a wiki, and yet another provides information and inspiration to those who want to help marginalized groups but may not know where to start.

The goal is to use the information and resources that exist, such as the Joshua Project database, and to package it up to faciliate events that genuinely help the people in our community that most need help.
